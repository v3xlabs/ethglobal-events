# ETHGlobal Event Calendar

This repository aims to provide an iCal (.ics)-compatible calendar for ETHGlobal events.

## Add the calendar

If you are using a native calendar app you can use the following URL to add the calendar:

```
webcal://v3x.events/ethglobal.ics
```

For some calendar apps this will not work and you will have to use the https URL instead (Thunderbird, Google Calendar, etc.):

```
https://v3x.events/ethglobal.ics
```
